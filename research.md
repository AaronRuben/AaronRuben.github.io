My research focuses on understanding the evolutionary dynamics and implications of admixture and introgression, that is, the mixing of populations that have been separated for relative short and long evolutionary time, respectively. Given their central role to human evolution, I am interested how they have shaped present-day genetic variation and disease risk.
